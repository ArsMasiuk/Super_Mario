## About
This was a school project that had several contributors. Qt Creator was used for development on this project. The game is not 100% complete and there is plenty of room for improvement. However, you may find many of the techniques used here to be helpful in building your own games or programs. The game was designed to use a database to allow account creation and login functionality. You would need to use your own database in order to use this feature. The guest login button can be used to bypass the username and password login. 

Use the arrow keys to make Mario walk. Use spacebar to jump. Use the F key to fire.
